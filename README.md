# Recurrent policy gradients

This project contains a simple tensorflow implementation of recurrent policy gradients [1]. For an alternative presentation of recurrent policy gradients, see [2].
          
This implementation is not particularly clear, efficient, well tested, or numerically stable. We advise against using this software for nondidactic purposes.

## Examples

See the examples directory. Remember to add the (outermost) rpg folder to the PYTHONPATH.
